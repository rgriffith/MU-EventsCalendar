<p><strong>Synopsis:&#160;</strong> BOMBER, a film by Paul Cotter. Alistar and Valerie have been planning a special trip to Germany for a very long time. When their son Ross stops by the house to send them off, happenstance turns into an impromptu family road trip of the most tortuous kind. Alistar berates Ross for all that he is not in life, while Valerie tries to keep the peace. It is soon discovered that Alistar's reason for the often comic, sometimes painful trip is to shed a guilt he's been carrying for years. Ultimately, the family learns they need each other more then they imagined. Premiered at the SXSW (South by Southwest) Film Festival where it played in competition and was nominated for the Grand Jury Prize.</p>

<strong>Synopsis</strong>: THE WIND JOURNEYS, a film by Ciro Guerra. For most of his life, Ignacio Carrillo traveled the villages of northern Colombia, playing traditional songs on his accordion, a legendary instrument said to have once belonged to the devil. He eventually married and settled in a small town, leaving the nomadic life behind. But after the traumatic death of his wife, he vows to never play the accursed accordion again, and embarks on one last journey to return the instrument to its rightful owner. On the way, Ignacio is followed by Ferm&#237;n, a spirited teenager determined to become his apprentice. Tired of loneliness, Ignacio accepts the young man as his pupil and together they traverse the vast Colombian terrain, discovering the musical diversity of Caribbean culture. Hardened by a life of solitude, Ignacio tries to discourage Ferm&#237;n from following in his footsteps, but destiny has different plans for them. Colombia / 2009 / Drama / In Spanish with English subtitles.</p>

<p>Mr. Rigney oversees the transition of new technologies and scientific applications from the research and development community.&#160; He provides scientific and technical leadership in the application of the ocean sciences to the Naval Oceanographic Office (NAVOCEANO) mission of operationally supporting Navy and other Department of Defense planning and operations.</p>
<p>NAVOCEANO applies science and technology to provide U.S. Navy planners and operators with knowledge of the marine environment and its impact on operations. An overview of the roles of oceanographers, marine geologists, meteorologists, and other scientists in supporting this mission will be given. A specific example, ocean prediction, will be explored in order to illustrate the interaction between various earth system disciplines. Global and regional numerical ocean models are run each day at NAVOCEANO in order to predict currents, temperature, salinity, and optics. Atmospheric forcing is a direct and critical input to these models, while atmospheric corrections are needed to obtain accurate satellite-derived sea surface temperatures and elevations. Bathymetry provides the crucial lower boundary condition. This presentation will describe the atmospheric inputs, the overall predictive system, and the emerging use of tightly coupled air-ocean modeling systems at NAVOCEANO. Finally, career opportunities for geoscientists at NAVOCEANO will be described.</p>

<p>The MU Department of Geography and Transition Lancaster presents, Climate Ethics: The Crucial Missing Element in the Climate Change Debate, January 26, from 6-8 p.m.</p>
<p>A Lecture by Dr. Donald A. Brown, The Pennsylvania State University</p>
<p>What is the crucial missing element in the U.S. debate about climate change? Ethics.</p>
<p>Climate change must be seen as raising several civilization-challenging ethical challenges for the human race, yet, for the most part, these ethical questions have gone unexamined in public discussions of climate change issues. Brown will argue that the failure to look at climate change as an ethical problem has practical consequences. Join Millersville University's Geography Department and Transition Lancaster for a lively lecture and discussion!</p></fulldesc><keywords/><categories><cat>cultural</cat></categories><location>McComsey Hall, Room 260</location><contact><name>Dr. Kathy Schreiber</name><phone>717-872-3630</phone><email>Kathleen.Schreiber@millersville.edu</email></contact><image><thumb/><large/></image><relatedlinks/></event><event featured="true" id="f4b5718f7f00000100f9a36a6830169f"><title>Martin Luther King Jr. Celebration with Julian Bond </title><createdon>1275415851</createdon><startdate>1296174600</startdate><enddate/><shortdesc>Help celebrate the legacy of Martin Luther King Jr. with Julian Bond.</shortdesc><fulldesc><p><strong>Description</strong>: Celebrate the legacy of Dr.Martin Luther King Jr. with Julian Bond.</p>

But, they know that there is something more. There is some idea, some mechanism, some accidental side effect that is standing between them and a pure leap of innovation. And so, through trial and error they are building the device that is missing most. However, two of these men find the device and immediately realize that it is too valuable to market. The limit of their trust in each other is strained when they are faced with the question, If you always want what you can't have, what do you want when you can have anything?</p>

<p><strong>Description</strong>:The 2010-2011 Humanities Film Series displays the variety of Millersville University's offerings. &#160;The Series features 22 film-related events to complement different areas of interest within the Millersville University community. The two main subseries include: the ReFraming Experience Series (to invite participants to consider ways of reframing the experiences around them by looking at the pivotal films of the 1960s and 1970s); and the ReFraming Time Series (to foster understanding of different ways of experiencing time and to complement the common reading, Einstein's Dreams).</p>
<p>Each film event in the Series is followed by a discussion of the ideas, issues, and challenges that the film experience provides. &#160;Discussions are led both by faculty members and students, as well as invited guests.</p>
<p><strong>This event is free and open to the public.</strong></p></fulldesc><keywords/><categories><cat>academic</cat><cat>cultural</cat><cat>university</cat></categories><location>Myers Auditorium, McComsey Hall</location><contact><name>Jill Craven</name><phone>717-872-3627</phone><email>jill.craven@millersville.edu</email></contact><image><thumb>http://www.millersville.edu/calendar/events/2011/02/img/Primer.jpg</thumb><large>http://www.millersville.edu/calendar/events/2011/02/img/Primer.jpg</large></image><relatedlinks/></event><event featured="false" id="a02703237f00000100258097ee6cffc4"><title>Residency: Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl</title><createdon>1295472067</createdon><startdate>1296846000</startdate><enddate/><shortdesc>Millersville University Theatre presents The American Place Theatre's Literature to Life stage presentation of Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl By Harriet Jacobs Performed by Cherita Armstrong Adapted and Directed by Wynn Handman.</shortdesc><fulldesc><p>Millersville University Theatre presents The American Place Theatre's Literature to Life stage presentation of Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl By Harriet Jacobs Performed by Cherita Armstrong Adapted and Directed by Wynn Handman.</p>

Our nation's food supply is now controlled by a handful of corporations that often put profit ahead of consumer health, the livelihood of the American farmer, the safety of workers and our own environment.</p>
<p>We have bigger-breasted chickens, the perfect pork chop, insecticide-resistant soybean seeds, even tomatoes that won't go bad, but we also have new strains of e coli--the harmful bacteria that causes illness for an estimated 73,000 Americans annually. We are riddled with widespread obesity, particularly among children, and an epidemic level of diabetes among adults.</p>
<p><strong>Discussant</strong>: Dr. Julie Lombardi, Associate Professor, and Dr. Adele Ruszak, Assistant Professor, Wellness and Sports Sciences</p>
<p><strong>Sponsor</strong>: The Office of the Dean of Humanities and Social Sciences and the Department of Wellness and Sports Sciences.</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong>:The 2010-2011 Humanities Film Series displays the variety of Millersville University's offerings. &#160;The Series features 22 film-related events to complement different areas of interest within the Millersville University community. The two main subseries include: the ReFraming Experience Series (to invite participants to consider ways of reframing the experiences around them by looking at the pivotal films of the 1960s and 1970s); and the ReFraming Time Series (to foster understanding of different ways of experiencing time and to complement the common reading, Einstein's Dreams).</p>
<p>Each film event in the Series is followed by a discussion of the ideas, issues, and challenges that the film experience provides. &#160;Discussions are led both by faculty members and students, as well as invited guests.</p>
<p><strong>This event is free and open to the public.</strong></p></fulldesc><keywords/><categories><cat>academic</cat><cat>cultural</cat><cat>university</cat></categories><location>Myers Auditorium, McComsey Hall</location><contact><name>Jill Craven</name><phone>717-872-3627</phone><email>jill.craven@millersville.edu</email></contact><image><thumb>http://www.millersville.edu/calendar/events/2011/02/img/Food Inc.jpg</thumb><large>http://www.millersville.edu/calendar/events/2011/02/img/Food Inc.jpg</large></image><relatedlinks/></event><event featured="false" id="0605d6197f00000100258097e17019c8"><title>NORTH SIDE BISTRO DINING HALL</title><createdon>1297181169</createdon><startdate>1297252800</startdate><enddate>1297296000</enddate><shortdesc>NORTH SIDE BISTRO DINING HALL</shortdesc><fulldesc>

Come hear her speak about her own journey as well as be educated on many issues faced daily.</shortdesc><fulldesc><p>Donna Rose, born as David, knew that as a man, she was not fully able to express herself. Because of this, she began the transition to become Donna. She speaks world wide educating people on the issues based around the LGBTQ community. It is no secret that there are extreme negatives pushed upon individuals because of their lives. Donna strongly believes that the best way to end this violence and negativity is through education.</p>
<p>On Monday, February 14, 2011, Rose will be in the Ford Atrium from 11 a.m. - 1 p.m. There will be an informal discussion from 11 a.m. - 12 p.m. and from 12 - 1 p.m. will be her more formal talk.</p>
<p>Donna now works for Common Roads Center. This is a center that runs on donations in Lancaster. It is a safe haven for members of the LGBTQ community. A Valentine's bake sale will be held outside of the Atrium in order to raise money to keep the center running.</p>
<p>It is crucial to take the time to attend events such as these in order to educate ourselves about the world and people around us. You never know what situations and people you will be meeting in your life, therefore wouldn't you like to be able to learn as much as you can about all different cultures while you have the chance?</p>
<p>Rose is a nationally recognized speaker, educator and advocate on transgender and transsexual issues. She is active in the leadership of several national GLBT advocacy organizations, is the author of an award-winning memoir, is heavily involved in national corporate diversity efforts.</p>

Graphics depict some of Einstein's famous thought experiments including his eventual understanding of the interplay between the speed of light and time and his development of the special theory of relativity. The program also goes into depth about Einstein's personal life, including his romance with and marriage to fellow student Mileva Maric and the death of his father.</p>
<p>Einstein addresses gravitation in the universe with his general theory of relativity. This is confirmed experimentally in 1919 when a solar eclipse reveals stars in positions that could best be explained by his theory: that gravity causes light to bend.</p>
<p><strong>Discussant</strong>: Dr. Mike Nolan, professor of physics</p>
<p><strong>Sponsor</strong>: The University Theme Committee, the Office of the Dean of Humanities and Social Sciences and the Department of Physics.</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong>:The 2010-2011 Humanities Film Series displays the variety of Millersville University's offerings. &#160;The Series features 22 film-related events to complement different areas of interest within the Millersville University community. The two main subseries include: the ReFraming Experience Series (to invite participants to consider ways of reframing the experiences around them by looking at the pivotal films of the 1960s and 1970s); and the ReFraming Time Series (to foster understanding of different ways of experiencing time and to complement the common reading, Einstein's Dreams).</p>
<p>Each film event in the Series is followed by a discussion of the ideas, issues, and challenges that the film experience provides. &#160;Discussions are led both by faculty members and students, as well as invited guests.</p>
<p><strong>This event is free and open to the public.</strong></p></fulldesc><keywords/><categories><cat>academic</cat><cat>cultural</cat><cat>university</cat></categories><location>Myers Auditorium, McComsey Hall</location><contact><name>Jill Craven</name><phone>717-872-3627</phone><email>jill.craven@millersville.edu</email></contact><image><thumb>http://www.millersville.edu/calendar/events/2011/02/img/Einstein Revealed.jpg</thumb><large>http://www.millersville.edu/calendar/events/2011/02/img/Einstein Revealed.jpg</large></image><relatedlinks/></event><event featured="false" id="2f231c577f00000100258097ea58c059"><title>UPPER DECK DINING HALL </title><createdon>1297870953</createdon><startdate>1298030400</startdate><enddate>1298073600</enddate><shortdesc>UPPER DECK DINING HALL MENUS</shortdesc><fulldesc>

Tess, a retired dancer and owner of the venue, struggles to keep the aging theater alive, facing all kinds of financial and artistic challenges. With the Lounge's troupe members becoming increasingly distracted by personal problems and a threat coming from a wealthy businessman's quest to buy the spot from Tess, the good fortune seems to have abandoned the club altogether. Meanwhile, the life of Ali, a small-town girl from Iowa, is about to change dramatically. Hired by Tess as a waitress at the Lounge, Ali escapes a hollow past and quickly falls in love with the art of burlesque. Backed by newfound friends amongst the theater's crew, she manages to fulfill her dreams of being on stage herself. Things take a dramatic turn though when Ali's big voice makes her become the main attraction of the revue.</p>
<p>This movie will be shown at 9:30 p.m. and 12 a.m.</p>

Millersville University will host the 2011 Student Entrepreneur Conference, February 22, from 4-8 p.m., with special guest speaker Randal Pinkett, Ph.D., fourth season winner of the popular TV show, "The Apprentice."</p>
<p><strong>Biography</strong>: Pinkett is the founder, chairman and CEO of BCT Partners in Newark, N.J., a consulting firm that he started during his undergraduate years at Rutgers University. Pinkett holds five degrees including a master's degree from the University of Oxford in England and a Ph.D. from the Massachusetts Institute for Technology.</p>
<p>Pinkett's book, "Campus CEO," is a guide for students on starting their own multi-million dollar businesses, during or after college. He also hosts the Campus CEO Challenge, a contest for high school and college students who wish to start their own businesses. The winners receive money to startup their business, as well as a consultation with Pinkett.</p>
<p>This year's conference will include breakout sessions exploring internships, networking and taking advantage of opportunities.</p>
<p><strong>The conference, which will be held on campus, in the Lehr Room, Gordinier Hall, is free and open to students. Registration is required; the first fifty students that register will receive a copy of Pinkett's book, "Campus CEO."</strong></p>

Set in the swinging '60s in London, the film focuses on a mod fashion photographer (David Hemmings) whose life changes when he realizes he accidentally may have taken a photograph of a murder.</p>
<p><strong>Discussant</strong>: Dr. Jen Miller, assistant professor of philosophy</p>
<p><strong>Sponsor</strong>: The Office of the Dean of Humanities and Social Sciences</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong>:The 2010-2011 Humanities Film Series displays the variety of Millersville University's offerings. &#160;The Series features 22 film-related events to complement different areas of interest within the Millersville University community. The two main subseries include: the ReFraming Experience Series (to invite participants to consider ways of reframing the experiences around them by looking at the pivotal films of the 1960s and 1970s); and the ReFraming Time Series (to foster understanding of different ways of experiencing time and to complement the common reading, Einstein's Dreams).</p>
<p>Each film event in the Series is followed by a discussion of the ideas, issues, and challenges that the film experience provides. &#160;Discussions are led both by faculty members and students, as well as invited guests.</p>
<p><strong>This event is free and open to the public.</strong></p></fulldesc><keywords/><categories><cat>academic</cat><cat>cultural</cat><cat>university</cat></categories><location>Myers Auditorium, McComsey Hall</location><contact><name>Jill Craven</name><phone>717-872-3627</phone><email>jill.craven@millersville.edu</email></contact><image><thumb>http://www.millersville.edu/calendar/events/2011/02/img/Blow Up.jpg</thumb><large>http://www.millersville.edu/calendar/events/2011/02/img/Blow Up.jpg</large></image><relatedlinks/></event><event featured="false" id="399497337f00000100258097cf5c62db"><title>NORTH SIDE BISTRO DINING HALL</title><createdon>1298046162</createdon><startdate>1298462400</startdate><enddate>1298505600</enddate><shortdesc>NORTH SIDE BISTRO DINING HALL MENUS</shortdesc><fulldesc>

Unlike the original play which featured only 7 women known by colors performing the collection of 20 poems, the movie has given each of the 20 characters names. Each of the poems deal with intense issues that particularly impact women in a thought-provoking commentary on what it means to be a female of color in the world.</p>
<p>The movie will be shown Saturday evening at 9:30 p.m. and 12 a.m. in Myers Auditorium.</p>
<p>The film is being shown as part of the spring movie roster for Ville After Dark.</p>
<p>It is part of a three-day program around the movie. The February 25th event will be a lecture with Simone. Simone, the daughter of Nina Simone, is featured on the soundtrack for the film. The February 26th event will be the presentation of the film For Colored Girls. The February 28th event will be a panel of campus members discussing the impact of the movie and orignal play on our culture.</p></fulldesc><keywords>millersville university, calendar, event</keywords><categories><cat>cultural</cat><cat>student</cat><cat>university</cat></categories><location>Myers Auditorium, McComsey Hall</location><contact><name>Andrew Moyer</name><phone>3508</phone><email>andrew.moyer@gmail.com</email></contact><image><thumb>http://www.millersville.edu/calendar/events/2011/02/img/For Colored Girls.jpg</thumb><large>http://www.millersville.edu/calendar/events/2011/02/img/For Colored Girls.jpg</large></image><relatedlinks><link><name>For Colored Girls - IMDB</name><url>http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1405500/</url></link></relatedlinks></event><event featured="false" id="3982248e7f000001002580975c61429e"><title>UPPER DECK DINING HALL</title><createdon>1298044953</createdon><startdate>1298808000</startdate><enddate>1298851200</enddate><shortdesc>UPPER DECK DINING HALL MENUS</shortdesc><fulldesc>

Starting in 2092, this imaginative and philosophical film explores the effect of choices on potential futures. Artsy and creative, the film slides between three possible life experiences using an innovative editing structure to engage spectators in the construction of the stories--essentially, the viewers mix the film into meaning (or not).</p>
<p><strong>Discussant</strong>: Dr. Jill Craven, associate professor of film studies and Members of the Cine Club.</p>
<p><strong>Sponsors</strong>: The University Theme Committee and The Office of the Dean of Humanities and Social Sciences</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong>:The 2010-2011 Humanities Film Series displays the variety of Millersville University's offerings. &#160;The Series features 22 film-related events to complement different areas of interest within the Millersville University community. The two main subseries include: the ReFraming Experience Series (to invite participants to consider ways of reframing the experiences around them by looking at the pivotal films of the 1960s and 1970s); and the ReFraming Time Series (to foster understanding of different ways of experiencing time and to complement the common reading, Einstein's Dreams).</p>
<p>Each film event in the Series is followed by a discussion of the ideas, issues, and challenges that the film experience provides. &#160;Discussions are led both by faculty members and students, as well as invited guests.</p>

<p><strong>Description</strong>: Hill Harper, Esq., "Motivating Young Men to be the Architect of Their Life."</p>
<p><strong>Biography</strong>: Harper has won legions of admirers for his soulful portrayal of "Dr. Sheldon Hawkes" on the hit drama series <em>CSI: New York</em>. A talented actor, Harper's passion for his craft is surpassed only by his dedication to inspire America's youth. A firm believer that identity is not defined by skin color or circumstance, the charismatic Harper encourages audiences to "take your biggest dream, and double it."</p>
<p>Harper's newest book, <em>The Conversation</em>, explores the nature of love across generations and the current state of male-female relations. It offers practical solutions on how to improve communication across gender and age.</p>
<p>Wanting to make a mark past his writing, Harper works to enable positive social change as a spokesman and volunteer for Big Brothers, Big Sisters. Today, he continues in his efforts to better America's social climate and guide our youth as a strong and articulate voice for hope, education, and commitment.</p>
<p><strong>Sponsors</strong>: Dr. Rosario Caminero Latino Celebration, Federick Douglass Celebration of Black Culture.</p>

<p>A drama by Romulus Linney. Directed by Tony Elliot</p>
<p><strong>Plot Summary</strong>: Set in the 1860s in a remote valley in the mountains of North Carolina, the action of the play centers on the desire of the Episcopal Bishop of North Carolina to bring the word of God to a community so removed and untamed that brothers marry sisters and the people live lives of brutal violence and grinding poverty. But trying to force strong willed people to accept organized religion is never a good idea.</p>
<p>In this play, which the Philadelphia Daily news called a "minor masterpiece," Romulus Linney creates characters who are at once sympathetic and horrifying, creating humanity and nobility in the most unlikely places and situations.</p>

After the death of the estate&#8217;s owner, Chance leaves the safe haven of his former television-dominated world and enters the so-called "real world" of the Washington politics. Although Chance only knows television and his garden, his lack of depth is mistaken for profundity by the Washington elite, and he is catapulted to fame.<br/>
<br/>
This film explores issues of identity as well as media celebrity, reminiscent of Oscar Wilde's idea that "most people are other people. Their thoughts are someone else&#8217;s opinions, their lives a mimicry, their passions a quotation."</p>
<p><strong>Discussant</strong>: Dr. Jen Miller, Assistant Professor of Philosophy</p>
<p><strong>Sponsor</strong>: The Office of the Dean of Humanities and Social Sciences</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong>:The 2010-2011 Humanities Film Series displays the variety of Millersville University's offerings. &#160;The Series features 22 film-related events to complement different areas of interest within the Millersville University community. The two main subseries include: the ReFraming Experience Series (to invite participants to consider ways of reframing the experiences around them by looking at the pivotal films of the 1960s and 1970s); and the ReFraming Time Series (to foster understanding of different ways of experiencing time and to complement the common reading, Einstein's Dreams).</p>
<p>Each film event in the Series is followed by a discussion of the ideas, issues, and challenges that the film experience provides. &#160;Discussions are led both by faculty members and students, as well as invited guests.</p>
<p><strong>This event is free and open to the public.</strong></p></fulldesc><keywords/><categories><cat>academic</cat><cat>cultural</cat><cat>university</cat></categories><location>Myers Auditorium, McComsey Hall</location><contact><name>Jill Craven</name><phone>717-872-3627</phone><email>jill.craven@millersville.edu</email></contact><image><thumb>http://www.millersville.edu/calendar/events/2011/03/img/Being There.jpg</thumb><large>http://www.millersville.edu/calendar/events/2011/03/img/Being There.jpg</large></image><relatedlinks/></event><event featured="true" id="f4cde3237f00000100f9a36a2dc2240f"><title>Hazel I Jackson Lecture with Walter Mosley</title><createdon>1275417453</createdon><startdate>1300836600</startdate><enddate/><shortdesc>Walter Ellis Mosley presents this year's Hazel I Jackson Lecture</shortdesc><fulldesc><p><strong>Description</strong>: Walter Ellis Mosley will present this year's Hazel I Jackson Lecture, March 22 at 7:30 p.m.</p>
<p><strong>Biography</strong>: Mosley is a prominent American novelist, most widely recognized for his crime fiction. He has written a series of best-selling historical mysteries featuring the hard-boiled detective Easy Rawlins, a black private investigator and World War II veteran living in theWatts neighborhood of Los Angeles; they are perhaps his most popular works.</p>
<p>Mosley started writing at 34 and has written every day since, penning more than 33 books in a variety of categories including non-mystery fiction, afrofuturist science fiction and non-fiction politics. Mosley made publishing history in 1997 by foregoing an advance to give the manuscript of Gone Fishin' to a small, independent publisher, Black Classic Press in Baltimore, run by former Black Panther Paul Coates. Mosley's fame increased in 1992 when then-presidential candidate Bill Clinton, a fan of murder mysteries, named Mosley as one of his favorite authors.</p>
<p><strong>Sponsors</strong>: This event is sponsored by the University Theme Committee, Dr. Rosario Caminero Latino Celebration and the Frederick Douglass Celebratioin of Black Culture.</p>

<p><strong>Plot Summary</strong>:</p>
<p>La Jetee- Chris Marker's short film La Jet&#233;e has haunted audiences for decades with its story of a WWIII survivor sent back in time to find a way to aid the post-apocalyptic world he inhabits. Marker uniquely unfolds the story using stills with narration, a structure that ignites questions about the nature of memory and time.</p>
<p>Denied Authenticity - In the video presentation of his installation, &#8220;Denied Authenticity,&#8221; Ben Cunningham presents the impersonal and detached relationship between America and its involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan through a simple yet profound mix of print and visual media. Distance and nearness are juxtaposed with names and faces. Ben&#8217;s condenses the complex issue of war down to a human, individual question. Viewers of &#8220;Denied Authenticity&#8221; will be compelled to come to terms with their perspectives of America&#8217;s foreign conflicts</p>
<p><strong>Discussant</strong>: Dr. Caleb Corkery, Dr. Greg Seigworth, Dr. Jill Craven, and Dr. Ben Cunningham</p>
<p><strong>Sponsor</strong>: The Office of the Dean of Humanities and Social Sciences</p>

<p><strong>Bio</strong>: In 2002, Dr. Richard Carmona, the 17th Surgeon General of the United States, was selected because of his extensive experience in public health, clinical sciences, health care management, preparedness and his commitment to prevention as an effective means to improve public health and reduce health care costs, while improving the quality and quantity of life. At the University of California Medical School, Carmona was awarded the prestigious gold-headed cane as the top graduate. Trained in general and vascular surgery, Carmona also completed a National Institutes of Health-sponsored fellowship in trauma, burns and critical care and was then recruited jointly by the Tucson Medical Center and the University of Arizona to start and direct Arizona's first regional trauma care system. He then became chairman of the State of Arizona Southern Regional Emergency Medical System, a professor of surgery, public health and family and community medicine at the University of Arizona, and the Pima County Sheriff's Department surgeon and deputy sheriff.</p>
<p>He is also a Fellow of the American College of Surgeons, President of the nonprofit Canyon Ranch Institute and the first Distinguished Professor of Public Health at the University of Arizona's Mel and Enid Zuckerman College of Public Health. Recently, DCarmona partnered with Lance Armstrong and the three other former U.S. Surgeon Generals to launch the first National Call to Action on Cancer Prevention and Survivorship.</p>

After the cash-strapped dad takes a job moonlighting for a drug company, however, Jack's suspicions about his favorite male nurse come roaring back. When Greg and Pam's entire clan-including Pam's lovelorn ex, Kevin (Owen Wilson)-descends for the twins' birthday party, Greg must prove to the skeptical Jack that he's fully capable as the man of the house. But with all the misunderstandings, spying and covert missions, will Greg pass Jack's final test and become the family's next patriarch...or will the circle of trust be broken for good?</p>

She has appeared on seasons 3 and 4 of HBO's Def Poetry Jam where she received several standing ovations. She also has shared the stage with artists such as Mos Def, Kanye West, Anthony Hamilton and the legendary Smokey Robinson. Gilmore's poetic style is very clear-cut and real. For her, all of life can be interpreted through her poetry. She presents them in a form that is rare, yet real. Dana speaks passionately, yet practically, about life's adversities, as well as alternatives for dealing with those realities. Some call writing a gift, for Dana, It's a calling.</p>

Since college, confirmed bachelor Ronny (Vaughn) and happily married Nick (James) have been through thick and thin. Now partners in an auto design firm, the two pals are vying to land a dream project that would launch their company. Ronny's girlfriend, Beth (Connelly), and Nick's wife, Geneva (Ryder), are by their sides. But Ronny's world is turned upside down when he inadvertently sees Geneva out with another man and makes it his mission to get answers. As the amateur investigation dissolves into mayhem, he learns that Nick has a few secrets of his own. Now, with the clock ticking and pressure mounting on the biggest presentation of their careers, Ronny must decide what will happen if he reveals the truth to his best friend.</p>

<p><strong>Biography</strong>: Harper has won legions of admirers for his soulful portrayal of "Dr. Sheldon Hawkes" on the hit drama series <em>CSI: New York</em>. A talented actor, Harper's passion for his craft is surpassed only by his dedication to inspire America's youth. A firm believer that identity is not defined by skin color or circumstance, the charismatic Harper encourages audiences to "take your biggest dream, and double it."</p>
<p>Harper's newest book, <em>The Conversation</em>, explores the nature of love across generations and the current state of male-female relations. It offers practical solutions on how to improve communication across gender and age.</p>
<p>Wanting to make a mark past his writing, Harper works to enable positive social change as a spokesman and volunteer for Big Brothers, Big Sisters. Today, he continues in his efforts to better America's social climate and guide our youth as a strong and articulate voice for hope, education, and commitment.</p>

<p>"Sofia's Journey" and"Daughters' Return" show the journeys of three teenagers as they search China to find their birth parents. Each one ends up searching for their own past, identity and place in relationships intertwined with abandonment and love.</p>
<p>More than 100,000 children have been adopted out of China in thelast two decades. Chinese birth parents are "invisible," for cultural and political reasons, resulting in adopted children not knowing their own roots. This lack of information for adoptees coming of age creates a sense of disappointment, frustration, loss and can lead to identity crises.</p>
<p>The documentaries were directed and produced by Dr.Changfu Chang, professor of communication and theatre, in collaboration with Millersville University faculty and students from departments including communication and theatre, English, music, art and sociology.</p></fulldesc><keywords/><categories><cat>academic</cat><cat>cultural</cat></categories><location>Myers Auditorium, McComsey Hall</location><contact><name>Dr. Changfu Chang</name><phone>717-872-3234</phone><email>Changfu.Chang@millersville.edu</email></contact><image><thumb/><large/></image><relatedlinks/></event><event featured="false" id="4a0d98467f00000100258097183a9ff1"><title>North Side Bistro Dining Hall</title><createdon>1302617495</createdon><startdate>1302778800</startdate><enddate>1302822000</enddate><shortdesc>North Side Bistro Dining Hall</shortdesc><fulldesc>

It limits life choices, professional options, and incomes, and weakens families and communities. Because children in low-income communities are predominantly children of color, they also face the added burden of societal low expectations and discrimination.<br/>
<br/>
That's where Teach For America comes in!<br/>
<br/>
Teach For America provides a critical source of well-trained t-eachers who are helping break the cycle of educational inequity. These teachers, called corps members, commit to teach for two years in one of 39 urban and rural regions across the country, going above and beyond traditional expectations to help their students to achieve at high levels.<br/>
<br/>
Rachel Martin, a recent graduate of Millersville University, is one of these teachers. Rachel will be here to speak about her experiences with TFA as well as TFA as a whole.<br/>
<br/>
After Rachel's talk, the 2010 film The Lottery will be shown. The Lottery uncovers the failures of the traditional public school system and reveals that hundreds of thousands of parents attempt to flee the system every year. The Lottery follows four of these families from Harlem and the Bronx who have entered their children in a charter school lottery. Out of thousands of hopefuls, only a small minority will win the chance of a better future.<br/>

Phil, a married high school teacher, has the same maturity level as his students when he's with his pals. Stu, a dentist, is worried about everything, especially what his controlling girlfriend Melissa thinks. Because she disapproves of traditional male bonding rituals, Stu has to lie to her about the stag, he telling her that they are going on a wine tasting tour in the Napa Valley. Regardless, he intends on eventually marrying her, against the advice and wishes of his friends. And Alan seems to be unaware of what are considered the social graces of the western world. The morning after their arrival in Las Vegas, they awaken in their hotel suite each with the worst hangover. None remembers what happened in the past twelve or so hours. The suite is in shambles. And certain things are in the suite that shouldn't be, and certain things that should be in the suite are missing. Probably the most important in the latter category is Doug. As Phil, Stu and Alan try to find Doug using only what little pieces of information they have at hand, they go on a journey of discovery of how certain things got into the suite and what happened to the missing items. However they are on a race for time as if they can't find Doug in the next few hours, they are going to have to explain to Tracy why they are not yet back in Los Angeles. And even worse, they may not find Doug at all before the wedding.</p>

Adam was a typical, hormonal 14 year old when he first came on to Emma at summer camp -- and got shot down in flames. In the years that followed, however, Adam and Emma continued to cross paths until eventually, they both caved to their animal instincts. Despite an intense session of earth-shaking sex, however, Emma makes it clear to Adam that the last thing she wants is a committed relationship. And thanks to the fact that Adam's father (Kevin Kline), a fallen television star, has just begun dating his son's ex-girlfriend, the horrified bachelor has developed an aversion to monogamy as well. At first their casual stance on sex works great for both; Emma can focus on her career instead of allowing her emotions to dictate her decisions, and Adam can play the field without fear of hurting her feelings. Over, time, however, a funny thing happens -- Adam began to develop feelings for Emma that he never had for any of his countless conquests. Before they both know it, love has reared its ugly head and they've gotten too emotionally involved to cut the relationship off cold. But is commitment in the cards for the couple that always swore it would never get serious, or has the time come for them to finally part ways once and for all?</p>

The scenes of the main storyline unfold backwards, keeping spectators curious about how time and memory interrelate. Spectators learn that Leonard actively remixes his present to his own emotional advantage.&#160;<br/>
<br/>
Like "Mr. Nobody," the film's creative structure engages spectators to create the film, exercising their imaginations with the potential structures the film's story could take.</p>

Lee will be on campus, in the Form Atrium of McComsey Hall from 2:30-3:30 p.m. for workshops with music classes, followed by a recital at 7 p.m.</p>
<p>This program features harpsichord music of the French clavecinistes and the North German school, as well as a work for flute or harpsichord by J.S. Bach.</p>
<p><strong>Artist Bio:</strong> As an award-winning early keyboardist, Lee, has been praised by critics for her "very high standard of playing" and her ability "to dazzle an enraptured audience." She has been heard as soloist at festivals as well as regional and international conferences.</p>
<p>As a continuo player on both harpsichord and organ, she has collaborated with numerous soloists and ensembles. An advocate of contemporary harpsichord music, she has performed works by such prize-winning composers as Dagmar Feyen, James Dorsa, Asako Hirabayashi, and Luis Mucillo. The recipient of numerous awards and grants, Lee is a laureate of the Montreal Baroque Galaxie-CBC Rising Star Competition, the Mae and Irving Jurow International Harpsichord Competition, the Canadian Music Competitions and the William E. Gribbons Award sponsored by the American Musical Instrument Society.</p>
<p>Currently, she is on the adjunct music history faculty at Illinois Wesleyan University.</p>

<strong>Film Synopsis</strong>: ONLY WHEN I DANCE, a film by Beadie Finzi. This feel-good documentary follows Irlan and Isabela, two teenagers from the violent favelas of Rio de Janeiro, as they pursue their dreams of becoming professional ballet dancers. This inspiring story takes us from Rio - where their communities must raise the funds to support their ambitions - to exhilarating ballet competitions in New York and Switzerland. It's a film about their determination to dance, and the price one must pay for talent, ambition and success.</p></fulldesc><keywords>millersville university, calendar, event</keywords><categories><cat>cultural</cat></categories><location>Meyers Auditorium, McComsey Hall</location><contact><name>Library Outreach</name><phone>717-872-3617</phone><email>library.outreach@millersville.edu</email></contact><image><thumb/><large/></image><relatedlinks><link><name>Facebook Event</name><url>http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=163489160356900&amp;num_event_invites=0</url></link></relatedlinks></event><event featured="false" id="aa1231cb7f00000100258097d10afb9c"><title>Ville After Dark: Baby Wants Candy</title><createdon>1295638475</createdon><startdate>1304121600</startdate><enddate>1304135940</enddate><shortdesc>Ville After Dark Presents: Baby Wants Candy</shortdesc><fulldesc><p>Baby Wants Candy (BWC) asks the audience for a title of a musical that has never been performed before.

<p><strong>Film Synopsis</strong>: JAFFA, a film by Keren Yedaya. In the heart of the Israeli city of Jaffa, Reuven's garage is a family-run business. The garage workers consist of Reuven's beautiful daughter Mali, his aggressive and distant son Meir, as well as the young Palestinian man, Toufik. No one suspects that Mali and Toufik have been in love for years, and that Mali is pregnant with Toufik's child. As the two lovers secretly make their wedding arrangements, tension steadily builds between Toufik and Meir, who openly voices his disdain and prejudices about Arabs. As these relationships continue to intensify, emotions begin to boil, resulting in an astonishing conclusion.</p></fulldesc><keywords/><categories><cat>cultural</cat></categories><location>Myers Auditorium, McComsey Hall</location><contact><name>Outreach Librarian</name><phone>717-872-3617</phone><email>library.outreach@millersville.edu</email></contact><image><thumb/><large/></image><relatedlinks><link><name>Facebook Event</name><url>http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=163489160356900&amp;num_event_invites=0</url></link></relatedlinks></event><event featured="false" id="91d706107f00000100258097c647efc3"><title>Upper Deck Dining Hall</title><createdon>1303821878</createdon><startdate>1304161200</startdate><enddate>1304204400</enddate><shortdesc>Upper Deck Dining Hall</shortdesc><fulldesc>

The exhibition runs from May 23 - July 1, 2011, and the gallery will host a reception for the artists Friday, June 24 from 5 to 7 p.m.</p>
<p>The collaborators used sensing experiences-blindfolded walks in the forest-as the basis for this installation. The installation attempts to create a similar "awareness experience" in viewers. Ultimately, the piece is a call for our attention, awareness and action in regards to our relationship with nature.</p>
<p>No pedestal pieces or wall hung art for this art installation. The entire Ganser gallery at Millersville University is transformed into the work of art itself: the gallery walls are shifted and the floor is covered with sand, clay, leaves, live plants, and other natural materials. Other atmospheric effects--such as altered lighting, video projections, sound and fans-complete the transformation of the space.</p>
<p>Lehman is a Lancaster artist that owns and operates Kevin Lehman's Pottery. The pottery has grown into a multi-media community art center that housed fifteen artists and offers classes to adults and children. Kevin recently founded the Lancaster Creative Factory that cultivates creative by providing arts and crafts outreach to underserviced youth and adults in the community. He is also working towards his Masters of Fine Arts degree at the University of the Arts in Philadelphia.He finds collaborations to be a crucial part of his artwork, "For me, the whole idea with collaborations are about community: coming together and working together to solve larger problems."</p>
<p>Ganser Gallery is located on Millersville University, just off the lobby of the Ganser Library. Gallery hours are Monday - Friday, 8:30 a.m. - 4 p.m. All Ganser Gallery Events are free and open to the public. Free tours of the exhibition may be scheduled by calling Ty Clever, Gallery Director: 717-871-2186.

Singer/Songwriter Showcase featuring Bess Rogers and Rachel Platten</shortdesc><fulldesc><p>Both events are FREE and open to the public.<br/>
<br/>
Bess Rogers<br/>
<br/>
Is Bess Rogers a folkie with pop rock instincts or a pop rocker with an acoustic bent? It's hard to place her in a neat category - and that turns out to be a source of strength for this eclectic singer/songwriter, Rogers - a member of Ingrid Michaelson's touring band - likes to surround her sweet lyric sentiments with a tough outer coating as she recounts tales of fumbled romance and fragile happiness.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Rachel Platten<br/>
<br/>
Rachel Platten crafts songs with beautiful, memorable melodies and intelligent, moving lyrics. Then she delivers them with her compelling and powerful voice. She is an accomplish guitarist and pianist with enough stage presence to make you forget that anyone else is in the room.<br/>

In the film, Kentridge talks about how his personal history as a white South African of Jewish heritage has informed recurring themes in his work including violent oppression, class struggle and social and political hierarchies. Additionally, Kentridge discusses his experiments with "machines that tell you what it is to look" and how the very mechanism of vision is a metaphor for "the agency we have, whether we like it or not, to make sense of the world."</p>
<p>The documentary was honored this past March with a prestigious Peabody Award. The Peabody board recognized "William Kentridge: Anything Is Possible" as "a veritable all-access pass to [William Kentridge's] mind and work process" given to Art:21 by an artist whom they describe as "creativity personified" and "a one-man seminar."</p>
<p>With its rich historical references and undertones of political and social commentary, Kentridge's work has earned him inclusion in Time magazine's 2009 list of the 100 most influential people in the world.</p>
<p>"Anything is Possible" was produced by Art:21: Art in the 21st Century, the award wining PBS television series. This event is co-sponsored by Millersville University Department of Art and Design and the Office of the Dean of Humanities and Social Sciences.</p>

This First Friday presents Lancaster Veteran's Art Project, Rev9 Dance Group and Singer/Songwriter Amanda Wells.</p>
<p><strong>Lancaster Veteran's Art Project Biography:</strong> The Veterans Art Project of Lancaster's purpose is to recognize, support and promote the talents and skills of local veteran visual artists by offering opportunities to display their work.&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Rev9 Dance Group Biography:</strong> Rev9 Dance Company, a local interdisciplinary dance company to perform excerpts from their new, original production, '77, from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m.</p>
<p><strong>Amanda Wells Biography:</strong> Her first guitar was pulled from a dumpster at a construction site where her dad was working and was handed to her after some furniture polish and a mixed set of half used strings. Despite the collection of varied instruments and equipment he owned, her father's knowledge of music consisted of a crude concept of the major scale only in C, and the fingering for basic G, C and F chords. She learned what she could from whoever could teach, and what couldn't be taught, she learned on her own. In October of 2010, Amanda released her first official album&#160;<a href="http://www.digstation.com/AlbumDetails.aspx?albumid=ALB000060897">Ebb and Flow</a>. The album was recorded at Underground Sound Productions outside of Lancaster, Pennsylvania. The songs are audible illustrations of the memories, trails and triumphs that trace through almost a decade of the singer-songwriter's life.</p>

This event will be held in conjunction with the University's One Book, One Campus, which is hosting multiple programs throughout the academic year focused around this year's selection of&#160;<em>Enrique's Journey</em> to enrich students.</p>
<p><strong>Discussants</strong>: Dr. Kimberly Mahaffy, associate professor and director of Latino Studies and Latino Studies students.</p>
<p><strong>Film Description</strong>: As the United States continues to build a wall between itself and Mexico, <em>Which Way Home</em> shows the personal side of immigration through the eyes of children who face harrowing dangers with enormous courage and resourcefulness as they endeavor to make it to the United States.</p>
<p>The film follows several unaccompanied child migrants as they journey through Mexico en route to the U.S. on a freight train they call "The Beast." Director Rebecca Cammisa (Sister Helen) tracks the stories of children like Olga and Freddy, nine-year-old Hondurans who are desperately trying to reach their families in Minnesota, and Jose, a ten-year-old El Salvadoran who has been abandoned by smugglers and ends up alone in a Mexican detention center, and focuses on Kevin, a canny, streetwise 14-year-old Honduran, whose mother hopes that he will reach New York City and send money back to his family. These are stories of hope and courage, disappointment and sorrow. They are the ones you never hear about &#173; the invisible ones.</p>

<p><strong>Film Description</strong>: "The largest domestic natural gas drilling boom in history has swept across the United States. The Halliburton-developed drilling technology of "fracking" or hydraulic fracturing has unlocked a "Saudia Arabia of natural gas" just beneath us. But is fracking safe? When filmmaker Josh Fox is asked to lease his land for drilling, he embarks on a cross-country odyssey uncovering a trail of secrets, lies and contamination. A recently drilled nearby Pennsylvania town reports that residents are able to light their drinking water on fire. This is just one of the many absurd and astonishing revelations of a new country called GASLAND. Part verite travelogue, part expose, part mystery, part bluegrass banjo meltdown, part showdown."

When this oddball duo arrives in the unassuming village of Santa Maria, business really takes off. The local newspaper sponsors the fight, and the quiet hamlet becomes plastered with posters announcing an open challenge to a worthy adversary. The ever-resourceful Orsini is sure he can find the right opponent to throw the fight, but fishing in Santa Maria yields a bigger catch than he'd hoped for. WINNER Best Actor, Mar del Plata International Film Festival; Best Supporting Actor, Slovene Film Festival.<br/>
<strong><br/>
A Call Girl:</strong> Having grown up in small-town Slovenia, 23-year-old Alexandra embraces the excitement and anonymity of big city life when she moves to the capital. She styles herself as a call girl, planning to take advantage of everything the city has to offer. But her isolated existence &#8212; English studies and mortgage payments by day, call girl lifestyle by night &#8212; is shattered when one of her clients, a visiting politician, dies of a heart attack on her watch. Alexandra must suddenly confront fear, guilt, and desperation as she finds herself pursued by a band of local pimps, as well the cops, hot on her trail. The old village life she had escaped from might now become her only refuge.

<p><strong>Film Description</strong>: This film is one of Chang's films that address timely issues concerning international adoptees. Sofia is the second of the three children adopted from China by Marilyn and Peter Robinson of Grand Junction, CO. A lead singer of her school choir and an accomplished dancer, Sofia often wonders where her talent comes from. Are her singing and dancing inherited traits? Her lack of knowledge of her birth parents has left her with an emotional void, a "hole in her heart."&#160; She has only a few "known" facts the orphanage provided: She was picked up by a company employee on his way to work and her birth parents had left a note. However, once in China, she finds herself struggling with a new identity: There was no such note from her birth parents and her birth date was fabricated for the sake of "quick adoption;" the worker claimed that he and his wife had adopted her, even producing an album with pictures of Sofia in the first six months of her life.

Teibele can't remarry until he's legally declared dead. Alchonon, a woe-begone, unemployed scholar, loves Teibele from afar, but she despises him. But Alchonon knows of Teibele's fascination for biblical demons and their powers, and devises an outrageous plan to woo and win her in the dark.

<p><strong>Discussants</strong>: Dr. Caleb Corkery, associate professor of English at Millersville University's students from his freshman seminar course, "Telling Your Story."</p>
<p><strong>Film Description</strong>: A heartbreaking documentary that upsets your expectations of happily-ever-afters, <em>Daughter from Danang</em> is a riveting emotional drama of longing, identity and the personal legacy of war. To all outward appearances, Heidi is the proverbial "all-American girl," hailing from small town Pulaski, Tenn. But her birth name was Mai Thi Hiep. Born in Danang, Vietnam in 1968, she's the mixed-race daughter of an American serviceman and a Vietnamese woman. Fearing for her daughter's safety at the war's end, Hiep's mother sent her to the U.S. on "Operation Babylift," a Ford administration plan to relocate orphans and mixed-race children to the U.S. for adoption before they fell victim to a frighteningly uncertain future in Vietnam after the Americans pulled out.

<p>It's the battle of the sexes - Elizabethan style. Who wins? Who loses? How can two people forge a marriage out of such chaos? How does anybody?</p>
<p>This beloved Shakespeare comedy is set in Padua, Italy, about 1600.Baptista, a wealthy parent, has a real predicament: He must marry off his two daughters and, honoring the rule of the day, his oldest daughter must be married first. But his oldest daughter is Katherina, the shrew!. No man in his right mind would tie himself to this angry, upstart of a woman but it seems that every man in Padua wants to marry her younger, beautiful, sweet, perfect sister, Bianca. What's a father to do? Enter puffed-up Petruchio who is determined to marry into a wealthy family and Kate fits the bill. With Petruchio's ego as large as Kate's temper, the challenge of "taming" this shrew creates comic situations of epic proportions.</p>
<p>As Petruchio says: "And where two raging fires meet together, They do consume the thing that feeds their fury."</p>

<p>It's the battle of the sexes - Elizabethan style. Who wins? Who loses? How can two people forge a marriage out of such chaos? How does anybody?</p>
<p>This beloved Shakespeare comedy is set in Padua, Italy, about 1600.Baptista, a wealthy parent, has a real predicament: He must marry off his two daughters and, honoring the rule of the day, his oldest daughter must be married first. But his oldest daughter is Katherina, the shrew!. No man in his right mind would tie himself to this angry, upstart of a woman but it seems that every man in Padua wants to marry her younger, beautiful, sweet, perfect sister, Bianca. What's a father to do? Enter puffed-up Petruchio who is determined to marry into a wealthy family and Kate fits the bill. With Petruchio's ego as large as Kate's temper, the challenge of "taming" this shrew creates comic situations of epic proportions.</p>
<p>As Petruchio says: "And where two raging fires meet together, They do consume the thing that feeds their fury."</p>
